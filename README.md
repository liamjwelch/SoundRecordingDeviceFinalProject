SoundRecorderFinalProject This is a project based on Daniel Kim's SoundRecorder (https://github.com/dkim0419/SoundRecorder) and Ravi's Note taker (https://github.com/ravi8x/AndroidSQLite). I have made additions to the original open source code's functionality by adding the ability to Annotate recordings.

Daniel Kim gives credit to these resources for his own project:
